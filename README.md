#	Uniform API Viewer
---
## Motivation
It bugs me up, that many many frameworks/librarys out there still come up with ugly 
structured and designed API documentations and/or manuals. However, once checked how 
to use the docs, I always find the information I am looking for. But at the end, those repetetive 
procedures become the less quick and intuitive the scruffier those informations are structured.  

To avoid such "workflow blockers" in the future, I decided to develop something that will give me 
API docs and other references straight to my fingertips. Nothin should be more than three clicks 
away and the everything should be formated in typographically pleasuring way so that specific
things can be found straightaway.

## Overview
Essentially, the UAV will consist of two main parts:

	1. The UAV data format (XML-dialect) and the
	2. Viewer-Application for UAV data files
